Brane is Membrane's AI assistant that lives in your sidebar, helping you develop Membrane programs. Brane can retrieve information from your programs, help create and modify code, and assist you in connecting different programs together.

## Get started

Click the Brane tab in the sidebar and start typing your request. Brane responds based on your active program and selected code.

## Core capabilities

**Create and modify programs**

Build complete Membrane programs or update existing ones.

**Design views**

Implement interactive [dashboard](/guides/dashboard) views with simple descriptions.

**Explore data**

Query your Membrane [graph](/concepts/the-graph/) directly without writing complex queries.

**Connect programs**

Set up [connections](/concepts/connections/) between programs to create automated workflows.

**Learn Membrane**

Get explanations and examples of Membrane concepts.

## Example prompts

```
Create a view for GitHub repositories showing name, description, and stars
```

```
Use the GitHub program and sys-email to send me pull request notifications
```

```
Show me messages from my Slack #general channel
```

```
Explain how grefs work in Membrane
```

## Context awareness

Brane understands your workspace through:

- Active program you're editing
- Code fragments highlighted with Cmd+K
- Program schemas and structure
- Program connections

## Code operations

When suggesting changes, Brane can:

- Update selected code sections
- Intelligently modify functions while preserving surrounding code
- Add new code to existing files
- Generate complete files

All changes require your approval before being applied.

## Tools

Brane uses specialized tools to interact with your Membrane environment. When you make a request, Brane automatically determines which tool is most appropriate without requiring you to specify it explicitly. You can ask to use a specific tool if needed.

| Tool               | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **RetrieveSchema** | Fetches program structure details       |
| **QueryGraph**     | Retrieves live data from your graph     |
| **AddConnection**  | Creates connections between programs    |
| **InvokeAction**   | Executes actions on graph nodes         |
| **CreateProgram**  | Builds new programs with generated code |

For example, when you ask "Show me my GitHub repositories," Brane knows to use **RetrieveSchema** and **QueryGraph** to fetch this data.

## FAQ

**How does Brane differ from general-purpose AI coding assistants?**

Brane is specifically designed for Membrane development. It understands Membrane's architecture and can interact directly with your Membrane graph.

**Does Brane require special commands?**

No, just use natural language to describe what you want to do.

**Can Brane help if I'm new to Membrane?**

Absolutely! Ask it to explain Membrane concepts and it will provide clear explanations with examples.

**How does Brane access my code?**

Brane accesses your active program and any highlighted code fragments. It respects your workspace structure.

**Can Brane execute actions in my Membrane graph?**

Yes, with your permission. Brane will ask for approval before executing any actions.

**Is there a limit to how much I can use Brane?**

Brane is included at no additional cost during the beta period.
