Membrane includes a `sys-sms` program in your workspace for sending
text messages programmatically.

:::note
You can only configure one phone number at the moment (to send texts to
yourself), but we plan to remove that limitation.
[Send us a note](mailto:contact@membrane.io) if that's something you'd like
asap, and/or upvote it on our [roadmap](https://docs.membrane.io/roadmap).
:::

## Configure

To configure `sys-sms`, find it in the Navigator, click the `configure`
action, type in your phone number, and hit "Invoke".

## Send

To send yourself a text manually, click on `sys-sms` in the Navigator,
click the `send` action, type in a `message`, and hit "Invoke". Check your
phone!

To send yourself a text programmatically, add `sys-sms` as a
[connection](/concepts/connections) to any program and call:

```
nodes.sms.send({ message: "whatever" });
```
