title: The IDE
---

Membrane's primary interface is the Membrane Web IDE. The IDE is where you write
and deploy programs, set up cron jobs, inspect logs, and more. We built our own
IDE to tightly integrate all our features and provide a great developer
experience.

get started.

You can open these docs as a webview in the IDE. Open the command palette
(`cmd/ctrl+shift+p`) and type `Open docs`.
