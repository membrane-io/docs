title: HTTP Endpoints
---

import Action from "@components/Action"
import Package from "@components/Package"

Every Membrane program comes with its own URL. By exporting an <Action name="endpoint" /> function you can quickly handle HTTP requests.

```ts twoslash
// @noImplicitAny: false
export const endpoint = ({ method, path, body, headers, query }) => {
  switch (`${method} ${path}`) {
    case "GET /":
      return "hello world"
    default:
      return JSON.stringify({ status: 404 })
  }
}
```

When your program endpoint receives a request it will be logged, so you can
inspect it in the Logs panel.

## Using a router

The endpoint function returns a string, but it's easy to use a nice router like Hono:

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono"
import { withRequestResponse } from "membrane-utils"

const app = new Hono()
app.get("/", (c) => c.html(`<p>Hello, Hono.</p>`))

export const endpoint = withRequestResponse(app.fetch)
```

See <Package name="pete/hono-taco" /> and <Package name="pete/hono-flags" /> for examples.

## Accessing an endpoint URL

To access a program's endpoint URL in your code, call:

```ts twoslash
// @module: esnext
// @noImplicitAny: false
// @filename: membrane.d.ts
/// <reference path="membrane_core.d.ts" />
/**
 * Represents the Process node in Membrane, providing process-related functionality.
 */
interface Process {
  /**
   * The URL of the program's HTTP endpoint.
   * `await nodes.process.endpointUrl`
   */
  endpointUrl: Scalar<string>
}

declare module "membrane" {
  /**
   * Contains the graph references (grefs) that this program has been given access to.
   */
  export const nodes: {
    readonly clock: Clock
    readonly process: Process
  }
}

// @filename: index.ts
import { nodes } from "membrane"
// ---cut---
await nodes.process.endpointUrl
```

To open an endpoint, click "Open Preview" above the `endpoint` function
signature. You can also copy a program's endpoint by right clicking on it in the
Navigator panel.

## http program

In Membrane all communication is done via the graph. So how can `fetch` make
network requests? Via a special program called `http`.

There is a special program running on your workspace called `http`. Whenever you
use `fetch`, the request will go through the `http` program which ultimately
makes the actual request.
