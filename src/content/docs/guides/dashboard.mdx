The dashboard is a customizable interface for viewing data and executing repetitive workflows. With the dashboard, you can quickly build utilitarian UIs on top of your Membrane programs.

In the video above, we add blocks to the dashboard representing a GitHub user, repo, and issue. Those particular views are defined in <Package name="membrane/github" />, but you can [create](#creating-views) and compose your own views to solve your needs.

We'll get to creating views, but let's start with the basics of using the dashboard.

## Using the dashboard

### Opening

To open the dashboard, click `DASHBOARD` in the top left of your editor.

![Open Dashboard button](@assets/open-dashboard.png)

### Installing

If you haven't already, [install](/concepts/packages/#installing) the <Package name="membrane/dashboard" /> package. This program will track the blocks you add to the dashboard and their position. Now you're ready to add stuff!

### Adding blocks

To add a block to your dashboard, simply drag 'n drop a [gref](/concepts/the-graph/#grefs-graph-references) onto the dashboard.

<video src="/videos/dashboard-drop.mp4" muted controls></video>

If the gref's node type does not yet have a custom view, select "CREATE CUSTOM VIEW" to make one. Or explore the node's fields, actions, and events by clicking "SHOW EXPLORER."

We cover [creating](#creating-views) and [generating](#generating-views) custom views below, but first let's discuss organizing and navigating around the dashboard.

### Moving around

To use the dashboard fluidly, run through this checklist:

- **Move** a block by dragging and dropping. The dashboard grid is intentionally coarse. Blocks are sized and positioned in 128px increments.
- **Resize** a block by dragging from its bottom right corner.
- **Pan** by scrolling with your mouse or trackpad. Press `shift` to scroll horizontally. Alternatively, middle click (scroll wheel) with your mouse and drag the dashboard background to pan.
- **Fullscreen.** Toggle by clicking the fullscreen icon button in the top right corner of the dashboard.
  {/* - **Arrange** blocks by clicking the hamburger menu icon button in the top right corner of the dashboard and selecting "Arrange blocks". */}
- **Picker mode.** Press `space` or click the dashboard background to zoom out, then click a block to focus it or press space/click again to zoom in on your mouse position. You can also hold `ctrl|command` and scroll to activate picker mode.
- **Stacked mode.** Selecting a gref embedded in another view will activate a breadcrumb-like horizontally stacked view, allowing exploration of nested data. Drag a gref from a stack column to persist as its own block. Click outside of the columns or press escape to exit stacked mode. Hold `shift` to see all elements with an explorable gref, `shift+click` to open stacked mode, and `shift+rightclick` for more options (copy gref, copy value, etc).
- **Explore mode.** Click "EXPLORE" in the top left corner of the dashboard, or right-click on the dashboard background and select "Explore Graph" to explore your program graph. Explore mode works like stack mode, allowing you to view nested nodes and peel/drag one off to place it on your board.
- **Inspect elements** by holding `cmd+shift` and hovering to see the corresponding code in [_views.tsx_](#creating-views). Click the element while holding `cmd+shift` to move your cursor to the relevant code in _views.tsx_.

Here's a demo of each movement described above:

### Managing boards

Boards are dashboard pages for organizing your blocks. Just as _spreadsheets_ have _sheets_, the _dashboard_ has _boards_. You might have a board for customer support and another for ad hoc Stripe actions, for example.

When the dashboard is open, you'll see the name of the current board in the top middle of the dashboard. Click on it to view, switch, and create new boards:

<video src="/videos/view-switch-create-boards.mp4" muted controls></video>

Boards and blocks are persisted in the `dashboard` program's [state](/guides/state). See <Package name="membrane/dashboard" />'s readme to learn more about how boards and blocks are implemented.

### Creating views

In this section, we'll explain how to create dashboard views by hand.

:::tip
To accelerate development of custom views, skip to the section below on [generating views with Brane](#generating-views).
:::

Custom views correspond to node types in a program. So if your program has a `User` type, you could create a custom `User` view that displays select fields (like `name` and `email`) and exposes an action (e.g. `disable`). Whenever you drop a gref of type User onto the dashboard, it will use the User _view_ you created for that _block_.

#### views.tsx

First, create a _views.tsx_ file in any Membrane program (_views.jsx_ works, too). To create a view for a type, export a function (or arrow function——dealer's choice) by the same name from _views.tsx_. E.g. for a `User` type, we export a `User` view:

```tsx
export function User({ self, compact }) {
  if (compact) {
    return <row>{self.email}</row>
  }

  return (
    <col>
      <row>
        <text style={{ fontSize: "large" }}>{self.name}</text>
      </row>
      <row>
        <text>{self.email}</text>
      </row>
      <row>
        <button action={self.disable}>Disable account</button>
      </row>
    </col>
  )
}
```

View functions receive an object parameter with a `self` property, which is a reference to the node. So this User view would have access to all fields, actions, and events on the User type. Views also receive a `compact` prop, which defaults to true when rendering collections and can be passed manually to [embeds](/reference/jsx/#embed).

The dashboard uses a Membrane-specific flavor of JSX. For full coverage of valid elements and styles, read our [JSX reference](/reference/jsx).

{/* To learn about Membrane's custom JSX implementation, read [how the dashboard works](#how-the-dashboard-works). */}

:::tip
While editing code in a _views.tsx_ file, corresponding blocks will be highlighted in the dashboard based on your cursor position. Or, press `cmd+shift` and hover over view code to highlight its corresponding blocks. You can also hold `cmd+shift` and click a block to go to its view code.
:::

### Generating views

While you can always write views by hand, it's usually more practical to generate a view in a matter of seconds. Just ask [Brane](/guides/brane/) to generate a view for a particular type, or for many types in a program.

{/* <video src="/videos/TODO:brane-dashboard.mp4" muted autoplay controls></video> */}

Once Brane spits out your view(s), use the generated code as a starting point or ask Brane to iterate. Or rely on inline editor completions as a middle ground between crafting by hand and full generation.

## How the dashboard works

As you may have noticed, `dashboard` is itself a Membrane program, <Package name="membrane/dashboard" />, that works in tandem with system code.

The program has actions to <Action name="put" />, <Action name="move" />, <Action name="remove" />, and <Action name="rename" /> blocks. It uses [state](/guides/state/) to store blocks you've added with some data and metadata for each block. It also stores _boards_ in program state. You can read through the program readme to learn more.

The canvas-like dashboard UI is implemented using JSX and Rust compiled to WASM. If you inspect the page via browser devtools, you'll see an HTML `<canvas>` wherein we run the compiled Rust code. We use a frontend Rust framework called [`egui`](https://egui.rs) along with a flexbox layout crate [`taffy`](https://crates.io/crates/taffy). The full cycle is JSX to JSON to Rust to WASM.

The code you write or generate in _views.tsx_ uses custom Membrane JSX. See our [reference page](/reference/jsx/) to see which elements and props are available.
