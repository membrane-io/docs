title: Introduction to Membrane
description: An overview of Membrane and its uses
---

<a href="https://www.membrane.io">Membrane</a> simplifies the process of building and deploying small applications using TypeScript. Popular use cases for Membrane are automation using APIs, email, text messages, long-lived workflows, cron jobs, webhook handlers, web scraping, chat bots, and many more.

## What's different?

Membrane's superpowers come from a few features that differentiate it from other JavaScript/TypeScript environments, most notably:

 - Programs are durable: there's no need to store/load data from a database, just keep data you want to save in the `state` object.
 - Access APIs via a unified graph: use external APIs with ease.
 - Everything is in the logs: Our runtime uses a write-ahead log, so if it's not in the logs, it didn't happen.
 - Built-in email: every program comes with an email address. Just export an `email` function.

Check out our <a href="https://www.membrane.io">homepage</a> for an overview of the main features and examples.
