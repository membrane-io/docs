description: An overview of Membrane and its uses
---

<a href="https://www.membrane.io">Membrane</a> is a fast, powerful way to write internal tools in TypeScript, connecting the apps you already use at work.

Popular use cases for Membrane include automations using APIs, email, text messages, long-lived workflows, cron jobs, webhook handlers, web scraping, chat bots, and many more.

## What's different?

Membrane has some superpowers that differentiate it from other JavaScript/TypeScript environments, most notably:

- _Programs are durable_: there's no need to store & load data from a databaseâ€”just keep data you want to save in the `state` object.
- _Access APIs via a unified graph_: use external APIs in a standard way without worrying about API quirks and reading lots of docs.
- _Everything is in the logs_: Our runtime uses a write-ahead log, so if it's not in the logs, it didn't happen.
- _Programmable email_: every program comes with an email address. Simply export an `email` function to programmatically handle incoming email.
