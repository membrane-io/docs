import Action from "@components/Action"
import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

When you first load the [Membrane IDE](https://ide.membrane.io), you'll see
a pre-installed `hello-world` program. We encourage you to start clicking around
and playing with the code!

That program has a <Action name="welcome"/> action that sends you an
[email](/guides/email). It also exports an <Action
name="endpoint"/> function that serves
[the program's website](/guides/endpoints) and track page views in
[state](/guides/state).

## Creating new programs

Creating a new Membrane program is simple:

<Steps>

1. Click `+ NEW` in the top left corner
2. Select "Blank program"
3. Name your program

</Steps>

That's it! The program is immediately deployed whenever you save the file. You
can also start with one of our templates for a cronjob, API, webhook handler,
emailer, or website.

We also have a
[`learn-membrane`](https://www.membrane.io/share/membrane/learn-membrane)
tutorial if you'd prefer a hands-on way to learn core features and concepts.
