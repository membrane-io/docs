import Action from "../../../components/Action";
import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

When you first load the [Membrane IDE](https://www.membrane.io/ide), you'll see a pre-installed `hello-world` program. We encourage you to start clicking around and playing with the code!

That program has a <Action name="run"/> action that sends you an [email](/features/email). It also exports an <Action
name="endpoint"/> function that serves [the program's website](/features/endpoints) and keeps track of the hit count in [state](/features/state).

## Creating new programs

Creating a new Membrane program is simple:

<Steps>

1. Click `NEW PROGRAM`
2. Click `Blank program`
3. Name your program

</Steps>

That's it! The program is immediately deployed whenever you save the file. You can also start with one of our templates for a cronjob, API, webhook handler, emailer, or website.

We also have a [`getting-started`](https://www.membrane.io/share/membrane/getting-started) tutorial if you'd prefer a hands-on way to learn core features and concepts.

## Sharing your code

Once you've made your first Membrane program, share it with the world! Right-click a program and select "Publish Package...", to push your code to our registry and generate a share link [like this one](https://www.membrane.io/share/iamseeley/ml-test).
