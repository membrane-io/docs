## `hello-world`

When you first load the Membrane IDE, you'll see a pre-installed `hello-world` program with its index file open. We encourage you to start clicking around and playing with the code!

That program has a `run` action that logs a message and sends you an [email](/features/email). It also exports an `endpoint` function that serves a website, storing hits in Membrane [state](/features/state) on each visit.

## Creating new programs

Creating a new Membrane program is simple:

<Steps>

1. Click `NEW PROGRAM`
2. Click `Blank program`
3. Name your program

</Steps>

That's it! The program is immediately deployed whenever you save the file. You can also start with one of our templates for a cronjob, API, webhook handler, emailer, or website.
