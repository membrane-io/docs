In this video we create a program called `new-program`, open its logs, and invoke its `run` [action](/concepts/schema#actions) by selecting the program in the Explorer panel. The results of the invocation can be seen in the logs.

## Exploring the tutorial program

When you first sign in, Membrane automatically installs a few programs in your workspace. One of those programs is `getting-started`, a guided tutorial to walk you through core Membrane features.

If you haven't already, we recommend going through the tutorial program to learn more about using Membrane. Or, continue to the next sections to learn more about Membrane features in depth.
