## Membrane Web IDE

Membrane's primary interface is the Membrane Web IDE. The IDE is where you deploy Membrane programs, set up cron jobs, inspect logs, and more.

Visit <a href="https://membrane.io/ide" target="_blank">membrane.io/ide</a> to get started.

### Orienting yourself in the IDE

When the IDE starts up, you'll see the Program Navigator (sidebar), Membrane Logs (bottombar), and a welcome/start screen (active tab). The welcome tab provides a quick tour of the Navigator and Logs.

The welcome tab also links to an interactive `getting-started` tutorial that comes pre-installed in your workspace. We recorded a <a href="https://share.descript.com/view/Smb0rEUzMkk" target="_blank">video walk-through of the tutorial</a> if you'd like to follow along with each step.

:::tip
We recommend going through the `getting-started` tutorial as your first Membrane program (with our <a href="https://share.descript.com/view/Smb0rEUzMkk" target="_blank">video recording</a>, if you'd like). It's a hands-on way to learn core features and concepts by doing.

## Membrane CLI

Membrane also includes a CLI tool called `mctl`. The CLI is for more advanced use cases and isn't required when first starting out. Feel free to skip ahead to the next section.

You can install `mctl` for any platform via npm:

```sh
npm install -g @membrane/mctl
```
