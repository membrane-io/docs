## Membrane Web IDE

Membrane's primary interface is the Membrane Web IDE. The IDE is where you deploy Membrane programs, set up cron jobs, inspect logs, and more.

Visit <a href="https://membrane.io/ide" target="_blank">membrane.io/ide</a> to get started.

You can open these docs as a webview in the IDE. Open the command palette (`cmd/ctrl+shift+p`) and type `Open docs`.

### Orienting yourself

When the IDE starts up, you'll see:

1. Program Navigator (left sidebar)
2. Membrane Logs (bottombar)
3. Program Details (right sidebar)
4. Welcome instructions & open program file, `hello-world/index.ts`

There are four Membrane programs pre-installed in your workspace:

1. [`http`](/features/endpoints/#http-program)
2. [`email`](/features/email)
3. [`sms`](/features/sms)
4. [`hello-world`](/getting-started/hello-world)

We'll cover each of these in subsequent sections. For now, continue to the next section to create your first program.
