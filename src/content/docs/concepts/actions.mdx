import Package from "@components/Package"

As mentioned in the [Schema](/concepts/schema) section, actions are functions that can be invoked on a graph node. There we gave the example of a `PullRequest` type in <Package name="membrane/github" /> with a <Action name="merge" /> action.

Conceptually, of field queries map to reads, action invocations map to writes (or producing a side effect). You could think of fields like `GET` requests and actions like `POST|PUT|DELETE`.

## Invoking actions

### Invoking programmatically

Picking up from our [Queries](/concepts/queries) section, we'll assume we have a program with a [connection](/concepts/connections) to the Membrane GitHub user like so:

| **Name** | **Gref**                                              |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `user`   | <Gref value="github:users.one(name:'membrane-io')" /> |

Let's query the repo for this docs site, find the latest pull request, and YOLO-merge it. Refer to docs on [querying collections](/concepts/queries/#querying-a-collection) for a refresher on pagination in Membrane.

```ts twoslash /merge.*/ "await latest.merge"
// @filename membrane.d.ts
/// <reference path="docs-modules/github-user/membrane.d.ts" />

// @filename index.ts
// ---cut---
import { nodes } from "membrane"

export async function example() {
  const prs = nodes.user.repos.one({ name: "docs" }).pull_requests
  const page = await prs.page().items.$query("number title")
  const { number, title } = page[0]

  if (number) {
    const latest = await prs.one({ number })
    latest.merge({ commit_title: `YOLO-merging ${title}` }).$invoke()
    // ---cut-start---
  }
}

export async function example2() {
  const prs = nodes.user.repos.one({ name: "docs" }).pull_requests
  const page = await prs.page().items.$query("number title")
  const { number, title } = page[0]

  if (number) {
    const latest = await prs.one({ number })
    // ---cut-end---

    // Instead of chaining `.$invoke()`, we could also simply await to invoke
    await latest.merge({ commit_title: `YOLO-merging ${title}` })
  }
}
```

In this example, we have a reference to a `PullRequest` node, which means we can invoke <Action name="merge" /> or other PR actions, like <Action name="createComment" />. Note that since actions are graph nodes too, they can be assigned to variables and referenced just like fields.

To see all the different ways to invoke actions in your code, including via timers, read our [actions API reference](/reference/typescript-api/#actiont).

### Invoking manually

You can also invoke actions manually, in the IDE sidebar and the [dashboard](/guides/dashboard). Here I'm invoking the `createComment` action on the PR that I'm currently working on:

<video src="/videos/invoke-action.mp4" muted autoplay controls></video>

:::tip
As an exercise, try finding a PR in one of your GitHub repos using the graph explorer sidebar, and invoke <Action name="createComment" /> manually. You could even set up a timer to comment later or on a schedule.

### Invoking from the CLI

Actions can also be invoked from the command line with our [`mctl` CLI](/reference/cli#action).

```shellsession
$ mctl action 'github:users.one(name:"membrane-io").repos.one(name:"docs").pull_requests.one(number:76).merge'
```

## Defining actions

For each action declared in a program's [schema](/concepts/schema), you must define a corresponding function that gets called when the action is invoked.

### On root

For example, when you create a new program using our blank template, we include a <Action name="run" /> action on its root node. To implement that action, we export a function from the top-level of the program's `index.ts` entry file, or export a `Root` object with a method.

```ts twoslash
export async function run() {
  // Do something
}

export const Root = {
  run: async () => {
    // This also works
  },
}
```

### On nodes

And what about actions on graph nodes more deeply nested in a program's schema? Let's return to the pull request example.

The <Package name="membrane/github" /> defines a `PullRequest` type with a <Action name="merge" /> action in its schema. To implement the merge action, the driver exports a PR object with a `merge` method:

```ts twoslash
export const PullRequest = {
  async merge() {
    // Call the GitHub API to merge the PR
  },
}
```

Refer back to the [Schema](/concepts/schema/#object-types) section for more detail on that PullRequest type, and view the <Package name="membrane/github" /> driver to see the source code (`index.ts`).
