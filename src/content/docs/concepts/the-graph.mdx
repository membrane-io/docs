## Introduction

In Membrane, each program defines a graph API to expose its data and
functionality to other programs.

You can think of the graph as objects that can be referenced by other programs,
allowing you to easily compose functionality and create useful abstractions.

For example <Package name="github" /> defines a <Type type='PullRequest'/> type
which you can use to interact with pull requests. You can then create a program
with a `Task` type that groups a <Type type='PullRequest' /> and an

<Type type="Issue" /> from e.g. Linear.

If you know about GraphQL this idea should sound familiar. In fact, we use a
simpler version of GraphQL to describe and execute graph queries.

The schema of a graph defines _types_ with _fields_, _actions_, and _events_.
You'll learn more about it in the [Schema](/concepts/schema) section.

Note that sometimes we refer to "The Graph" as the combination of all your
programs graphs.

## Grefs (graph references)

To reference nodes in the graph, Membrane uses a notation called **gref** which
stands for "graph reference". The gref syntax is pretty straightforward:

`program:path.to.node`

For example, if you have <Package name="github"/> running on your workspace, all
of these would be grefs that point to valid nodes.

| Gref                                                           | Type                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| <Gref value="github:"/>                                        | <Type type="Root"/>             |
| <Gref value='github:users'/>                                   | <Type type="UserCollection"/>   |
| <Gref value='github:users.one(name:"membrane-io")'/>           | <Type type="User"/>             |
| <Gref value='github:users.one(name:"membrane-io").bio'/>       | <Type type="String"/>           |
| <Gref value='github:users.one(name:"membrane-io").followers'/> | <Type type="Int"/>              |
| <Gref value='github:configure'/>                               | an [action](/concepts/actions/) |

<span data-pagefind-weight="10">Grefs</span> are like URLs for your graph. But unlike URLs, grefs follow a schema and
can have parameters on every part!

You won't be using this syntax directly from code, though, because Membrane
generates type-safe accessors for every field, action, and event which mirror
program schemas. This allows us to provide rich autocomplete and type safety.

## Nodes

Anything that is referenceable using fields is a <span data-pagefind-weight="10">node</span>.  All the grefs above point
to graph nodes except for the last one that points to an action on the root node.

We make this distinction because nodes are the things in your graph that can be
queried. Actions are invoked _on_ a particular node, and events are emitted _by_
a node.

## Connections

Programs can only access nodes that you explicitly allow them to access. These
are called _connections_.

Connections can be added from the right sidebar, either from the drop-down menu
or by dragging-and-dropping grefs onto it. Once you've added a connection, it'll
be available in the [nodes object](/reference/typescript-api#nodes).

Connections serve as an access control mechanism. Only programs that are
explicitly allowed to access a node can access it.

This also allows you to provide fine-grained access to only the data that's
needed. For example, if you write a program to track the number of stars in a
GitHub repo, you can add a connection to

| name  | gref                                                                                           |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| stars | <Gref value='github:users.one(name:"membrane-io").repos.one(name:"membrane-io").stargazers' /> |

Which makes `nodes.stars` available in your program.

```ts twoslash "nodes.stars"
// @module: esnext
// @filename: membrane.d.ts
interface Scalar<V> {
  /**
   * Gets the value of this field. This is equivalent to calling $query without arguments
   */
  $get: () => Promise<V>

  // This a scalar field thenable so that await'ing returns the right type
  then: Promise<V>["then"]
}
declare module "membrane" {
  /**
   * Contains the graph references (grefs) that this program has been given access to.
   */
  export const nodes: {
    readonly stars: Scalar<number>
  }
}

// @filename index.ts
// ---cut---
import { nodes } from "membrane"

export async function someAction() {
  const stars = await nodes.stars
  /* do something with stars... */
}
```

## Types

Graph nodes are typed. So each program defines a _schema_ that determines the
shape of its graph.

Here's an example schema from <Package name="resend"/> as shown in the IDE.

  driver](@assets/resend-schema.png)

In the [Schema](/concepts/schema) section, we'll learn about schemas and how
programs define their own graphs.

## Rationale

Most APIs represent objects that relate to each other. For example, GitHub
repositories have issues, which in turn have comments, which in turn have
authors, which in turn have repositories, etc.

```
Github Repository                          Slack Channel
   ↘                                         ↙       ↘
   Issue                              Message        User
      ↘                                  ↙              ↘
      Comment                     Reactions           (Slack Channels...)
         ↘
         User
            ↘
            (Github Repository...)
```

However, most APIs (with the exception of GraphQL APIs) represent these
relationships implicitly by using IDs. When using these APIs, you as a
developer, need to figure out how to correctly use these IDs to "traverse" the
implied graph.

The primary goal of the Membrane graph to allow you to easily traverse these
relationships without having to read API docs.

It turns out that this same abstraction allows us to implement pagination in a
unified way. Pagination is nothing more than a "linked list" of pages. In other
words, a graph:

```
Page 1 → Page 2 → Page 3 → Page 4 → ...
```

However, each API implements it differently. For example, GitHub paginates by
using the `Link` header, Slack uses `next_cursor`, and many APIs use a `page`
query parameter.

By modeling APIs as explicit graphs rather than implicit ID-based relationships,
and allowing you to reference individual nodes, Membrane provides a unified
interface for interacting with data in a way that matches your mental model.

By allowing you to reference individual nodes, the graph guarantees that
programs (especially ones you didn't write) can only access what they need, and
nothing else. It also enables visibility into everything a program has done.
Nothing is opaque in Membrane.

For example. Membrane programs need access to <Package name="http" /> to make
network requests since `fetch` uses these nodes under the hood.

In conclusion, The Membrane Graph is a powerful abstraction that:

- Abstracts away particularities of individual APIs like pagination, data
  formats, headers, webhook models, URL encoding, etc.
- Unifies how data is accessed regardless of its source (API resources vs. your
  own abstractions)
- Provides a way to declaratively reference data in a fine-grained way
- Allows for easy understanding of the flow of events and data
- Serves as an access-control mechanism. Programs can only access what you allow
  and nothing else
