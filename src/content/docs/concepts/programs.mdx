Membrane is similar to an operating system; you deploy programs to the Membrane engine, and it takes care of persistence, communication, logging, resources, etc.

A Membrane _program_ is TypeScript or JavaScript code that runs in Membrane's serverless cloud runtime. Unlike traditional serverless runtimes, it is [stateful](/features/state/) and includes multiple handlers instead of a single function.

A Membrane program consists of:

- **Code**: TypeScript/JavaScript functions for fields, actions and events
- **Schema**: nodes exposed in [the graph](/concepts/the-graph)—the program's own API
- **Connections**: other programs—nodes—used by the program
- **Implicit Handlers**: optional functions, e.g. to receive [HTTP requests](/features/endpoints)

In Membrane, you build custom functionality (bots, workflows, etc.) by writing programs. Programs can reference each other's nodes to create powerful abstractions.

## Code organization

A Membrane program contains at least three files:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<FileTree>
  - your-program/ 
    - index.ts 
    - memconfig.json 
    - memconfig.lock
</FileTree>

1. **`index.ts|js`:** contains core logic and exports resolver functions
2. **`memconfig.json`:** describes your schema with all fields, actions, events, and connections. It's automatically generated, so you should never have to edit this file by hand
3. **`memconfig.lock`:** tracks versions of nodes in your graph. It's also automatically generated, and you should never have to edit it manually

Your program's directory may also include a `README.md`, `package.json` with npm dependencies, `.git`, and whatever other helpers and structure you'd like.

## Stopping and deleting programs

To stop a running program, right click the program in the Membrane Navigator and select `Kill` from the dropdown menu. A program must be stopped in order to delete it.

:::caution
When you stop a running program, its `state` will be lost.
:::

To delete a program, right click the program's folder in your file explorer and select `Delete` from the dropdown menu. Or, open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and type _Membrane: Delete Program_. A message will appear in the bottom bar of your editor upon deletion.

:::danger
Deleting a program is a permanent action.
