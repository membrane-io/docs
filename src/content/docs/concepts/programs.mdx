## Durability

Membrane allows you to build functionality very quickly because, among other
things, you don't need to worry about persistence. Each program is its own
database.

Programs run in a durable runtime that transparently and efficiently persist its
state to disk. This is different from other serverless environments, where
programs can only run for a limited amount of time, typically a few minutes,
because CPU and RAM are expensive and servers need to be able to restart at any
time.

In contrast, Membrane is continually and transparently persisting changes to the
program's entire memory heap so that when a program goes idle, it doesn't
consume any CPU or memory, and our servers can be restarted without you
noticing. When a program needs to do something again, for example, handle an
HTTP request, Membrane lazily restores only the parts of the heap that are
needed so that "cold-starts" are fast.

Unlike other serverless runtimes, Membrane programs:

- Don't need to persist data to a database or file.
- Can run forever and will never be killed due to timing out.
- When you change the code, the new code continues the execution with the same
  [state](/guides/state/).

## I/O

The main challenge we faced when designing Membrane was how to handle I/O.

Conventional programs have state that simply cannot be persisted to disk. For
example, socket connections or open file handles. To solve this, all I/O in
Membrane is _externalized_, meaning that the programs don't directly interact
with the outside world by opening sockets. Instead, they write the request to
its write-ahead log and then Membrane takes care of executing it.

## Replays and time travel

Thanks to our write-ahead log and our deterministic JavaScript runtime, the
entire history of the program can be replayed. Which means you can go back in
time, inspect the state, debug errors after the fact and so on. These features
are currently being worked on. Subscribe to our

## Limitations

Membrane is not a silver bullet. One important limitation to keep in mind is
that, because of its stateful nature, programs cannot be scaled horizontally.
However, scaling is oftentimes not necessary! Learn more about
[when to use Membrane](/getting-started/intro#when-to-use-membrane).

Another limitation is that, due to our I/O model, you currently cannot stream
network responses. This is something we're working on fixing though! So, stay
tuned.
