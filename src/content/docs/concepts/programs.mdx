title: Durable Programs
---

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Membrane allows you to build functionality very quickly because, among other things, you don't need to worry about
persistence. Each program is its own database.

## Durability

Programs in Membrane are written in TypeScript and run in our cloud runtime. Unlike other serverless
runtimes, Membrane programs are [stateful](/features/state/) which means:

- You don't need to persist data to a database or file.
- There's only one instance of each program. No horizontal scaling by design.
- Execution never stops. Even when you change the code, the new code continues the execution with the same state.

Membrane continually and efficiently persists changes to the program's entire memory heap so that when the program goes
idle, it doesn't consume any CPU or memory. When the program needs to run again, Membrane lazily restores only the parts
of the heap that are needed so that "cold-starts" are extremely fast.

Behind the scenes, a program and its entire history is a SQLite file.

## Feature overview

### Graph API

Membrane programs expose their API in [a graph](/concepts/the-graph) that other programs can consume to create
useful abstractions. We'll learn more about this in [The Graph](/concepts/the-graph) section.

### Built-in HTTP and email

Every program comes with its own [HTTP URL](/features/endpoints) and [email address](/features/email) so you can
easily build functionality like webhook handlers, email automations, REST APIs, website prototypes, and more.

### NPM support

You can use many NPM packages (but not all) simply by creating a `package.json`. The IDE will transparently fetch the
packages for you.

### Deploy on save

Every time you change a program, Membrane will automatically deploy the new version. This allows to you iterate very
quickly.

"Deploy on save" can be disabled in settings if needed.

<Aside>
  We're working on having a separate "staging" instance where you can quickly
  iterate without affecting the main program instance.

### Membrane Packages

You can install programs created by other users or publish your own using [Membrane's package manager](/concepts/packages).
