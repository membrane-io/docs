Queries are the way to read data from a node. Now that you know how [schemas](/concepts/schema) shape a program's
[graph](/concepts/the-graph), let's talk about how queries work.

To illustrate this section, we'll assume that you have <Package name="github" /> running on your workspace. You can add the following node named `user` of type `User` as a [connection](/concepts/connections) to a program:

<div style="flex-grow: 1; display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 16px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; padding: 6px 2ex;">
  <Gref value="github:users.one(name:'membrane-io')" />
  <span>â†’</span>
  <Type
    client:load
    typed={{ type: `User` }}
    packageName="github"
    memconfig={githubMemconfig}
  />{" "}
</div>

You can click on the `User` type above to explore the entire GitHub program schema.

The above is a reference to a Github User which we'll be reading some data from. Feel free to change it to some other github username.

## Querying a node

Now that your program has access to a node named `user`, you can use `$query` and `$get` to read values from it.

Here are some examples:

```ts twoslash /= (await.*)/
// @filename membrane.d.ts
/// <reference path="docs-modules/github-user/membrane.d.ts" />

// @filename index.ts
// ---cut---
import { nodes } from "membrane"

async function run() {
  // Using $get() to query a string
  const bio = await nodes.user.bio.$get()
  // ---cut-start---
}

async function run1() {
  // ---cut-end---

  // For convenience, you can omit the $get() when querying a scalar
  const bio = await nodes.user.bio
  // ---cut-start---
}

async function run2() {
  // ---cut-end---

  // Query a sub-node
  const name = await nodes.user.repos.one({ name: "docs" }).description
  // ---cut-start---
}

async function run3() {
  // ---cut-end---

  // Use graphQL to get multiple values
  const { name, bio } = await nodes.user.$query("{ name bio }")
  // ---cut-start---
}

async function run4() {
  // ---cut-end---

  // Use $query() and graphQL to get all the data you need in one call
  const { name, bio, repos } = await nodes.user.$query(
    "{ name bio repos { page { items { name, description } } } }",
  )
}
```

Note that you can only query [scalar nodes](/concepts/schema#scalars-primitive-types). When querying objects nodes, you must specify
which fields to include by using `$query` and passing a GraphQL query. Here's an example that won't work:

```ts twoslash "await nodes.user"
// @filename membrane.d.ts
/// <reference path="docs-modules/github-user/membrane.d.ts" />

// @filename index.ts
// ---cut---
import { nodes } from "membrane"

// This won't work. Which fields do we want from the user node?
const user = await nodes.user
```

The above expression doesn't work because to query an object node you must specify which fields you want to get from it
using `$query` to provide a GraphQL query.

Finally, for convenience, you can omit the outer `{` and `}` when using `$query`. So instead of `"{ name bio }"` you can just write `"name bio"`.

## Querying form the CLI

You can make queries from the command line by using [mctl query](/reference/cli#query). For example:

```shellsession
# Query a scalar
$ mctl query 'github:users.one(name:"membrane-io").bio'

# To query an object, pass a GraphQL query
$ mctl query 'github:users.one(name:"membrane-io")' '{ name bio }'
```

## Resolving queries

## Query execution

This section explains how Membrane queries work by calling the functions exported from a program. You generally
don't need to think about this, but it's helpful to understand which functions are called when.

When a query is received for a node, Membrane first combines the gref and the query (if any) into a larger GraphQL query.

If we're querying `{ name bio }` on the above gref, the actual query that will be executed looks something like this:

```graphql
{
  users {
    one(name: "membrane-io") {
      # The lines above are derived from the gref
      # The lines below come verbatim from the original query
      name
      bio
    }
  }
}
```

Then, to resolve the values, Membrane will invoke these functions in order, which are all exported from <Package name="github" />:

1. `Root.users`
2. `UserCollection.one`
3. `User.name`
4. `User.bio`

The result of each resolver is passed as the `obj` argument to all child resolvers.

### Executing List fields

Resolvers of type `List<T>` must return an array of values. Membrane will then invoke the resolvers for each item in the array.

For example. If we wanted to get the `name` and `description` of all repos, we would typically use the following query:

```graphql
{
  repos {
    # The first page of repos
    page {
      items {
        name
        description
      }
    }
    # A gref to the next page
    next
  }
}
```

Membrane would invoke the resolvers in the following order:

1. `Root.repos`
2. `RepositoryCollection.page`
3. `RepositoryPage.items`
4. For each item returned by `RepositoryPage.items`
   1. `Repository.name`
   1. `Repository.description`

### Gref resolvers

Nodes in the graph are identified by their gref. Why? Because APIs typically use integers IDs, names or UUIDs to identify resources. However, a bare ID is not enough to interact with its corresponding resource. When using an API directly you'd also need to know which endpoints to hit and how to pass the ID.

By using grefs to identity graph nodes, we are able to "encode" all the information needed to interact with something.

All object types have an _implicit_ field aptly named `gref` which can be queried to get a reference to the node. The `gref` field, when queried, answers the question "what is the gref that points to this node?".

For example, we could query `user.gref` and would get back `github:users.one(name:'membrane-io')`. That's not very useful because we already knew that one. However, when querying a list of nodes, including `gref` in the query can be useful to know the identify of each returned item. We can then use the returned grefs to interact with each item individually.

Membrane's IDE uses grefs to identify each node. This is what enables you to click on a list item and interact with the corresponding node in a generic way (independent of how each API identifies its resources).

In most cases, you don't need to write a resolver for this field, but it's important for when you're querying a list of
nodes and you want to keep track of the identity of each item.
