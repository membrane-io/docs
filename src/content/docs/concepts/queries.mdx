Queries are the way to read data from a node. Now that you know how
[schemas](/concepts/schema) shape a program's [graph](/concepts/the-graph),
let's talk about how queries work.

To illustrate this section, we'll assume that you have <Package name="github" />
running on your workspace. We'll also assume that you have created a blank
program with the following node as a [connection](/concepts/connections) named `user`:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Gref</th>
      <th>Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>user</td>
      <td>
        <Gref value="github:users.one(name:'membrane-io')" />
      </td>
      <td>
        <Type
          client:load
          type={{ type: `User` }}
          packageName="github"
          memconfig={githubMemconfig}
        />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

You can click on the `User` type in the table above to explore the entire schema of <Package name="github" />. We'll be querying data from the above Github User. Feel free to change it to your own GitHub username.

You can install <Package name="pete/querying-docs-examples" /> to test out these examples in your own Membrane workspace.

## Querying a node

Now that your program has access to a node named `user`, you can use `$query`
and `$get` to read values from it.

Here are some examples.

```ts twoslash /= (await.*)/
// @filename membrane.d.ts
/// <reference path="docs-modules/github-user/membrane.d.ts" />

// @filename index.ts
// ---cut---
import { nodes } from "membrane"

export async function example() {
  // Using $get() to query a string
  const email = await nodes.user.email.$get()
  // ---cut-start---
}

export async function example1() {
  // ---cut-end---

  // For convenience, you can omit the $get() when querying a scalar
  const blog = await nodes.user.blog
  // ---cut-start---
}

export async function example2() {
  // ---cut-end---

  // Query a sub-node
  const description = await nodes.user.repos.one({ name: "docs" }).description
  // ---cut-start---
}

export async function example3() {
  // ---cut-end---

  // Use graphQL to get multiple values
  const { name, email, blog } = await nodes.user.$query("{ name email blog }")
  // ---cut-start---
}

export async function example4() {
  // ---cut-end---

  // Use $query() and graphQL to get all the data you need in one call
  const { name, repos } = await nodes.user.$query(`
    name
    repos {
      page {
        items { name, description }
      }
    }`)
}
```

Note that you can only query
[scalar nodes](/concepts/schema#scalars-primitive-types). When querying objects
nodes, you must specify which fields to include by using `$query` and passing a
GraphQL query. Here's an example that won't work:

```ts twoslash "await nodes.user"
// @filename membrane.d.ts
/// <reference path="docs-modules/github-user/membrane.d.ts" />

// @filename index.ts
// ---cut---
import { nodes } from "membrane"

// This won't work. Which fields do we want from the user node?
const user = await nodes.user
```

The above expression doesn't work because to query an object node you must
specify which fields you want to get from it using `$query` to provide a GraphQL
query.

Finally, for convenience, you can omit the outer `{` and `}` when using
`$query`. So instead of `"{ name bio }"` you can just write `"name bio"`.

## Querying a collection

Fields that return collections of data follow conventions for pagination. Let's take a look at that `repos` field we queried above for a GitHub user:

| **Gref**                                                    | **Type**                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Gref value="github:users.one(name:'membrane-io').repos" /> | <Type client:load type={{ type: `RepositoryCollection` }} packageName="github" memconfig={githubMemconfig} /> |

Click the `RepositoryCollection` type in the table above to inspect its schema. You'll see that the collection contains fields for `one<Repository>` repo and a `page<RepositoryPage>` of repos. Take a look at those types as well.

As a refresher on [querying a node](#querying-a-node), we can query fields on a single repo:

```ts twoslash
// @filename membrane.d.ts
/// <reference path="docs-modules/github-user/membrane.d.ts" />

// @filename index.ts
// ---cut---
import { nodes } from "membrane"

export async function example() {
  const docs = nodes.user.repos.one({ name: "docs" })
  const { description, homepage } = await docs.$query(
    "{ description homepage }",
  )
}
```

But how about querying a collection of repos and paginating through it? For that, we access the `page` field on our repository collection, which itself contains sub-fields for `items<List<Repository>>` and `next<Gref<RepositoryPage>>`.

```ts twoslash
// @filename membrane.d.ts
/// <reference path="docs-modules/github-user/membrane.d.ts" />

// @filename index.ts
// ---cut---
import { nodes } from "membrane"

export async function example() {
  // Get a reference to a RepositoryPage and paginate
  let page = nodes.user.repos.page()

  while (page) {
    const repos = await page.items.$query("name")
    page = await page.next()
  }
}

export async function exampleGQL() {
  // Or, use graphQL syntax to query all sub-fields at once
  let { page } = await nodes.user.repos.$query(`
    page {
      items { name }
      next
    }
  `)

  while (page) {
    const { items, next } = page
    page = await next?.$query(`{ items { name } next }`)
  }
}
```

Pagination UI in the IDE relies on these conventions for a `page` with `items` and `next`. You've likely already come across it in the explorer sidebar or [dashboard](/guides/dashboard).

For example, here in the sidebar we're flipping through pages of emilk's repos to find egui (the Rust frontend library that we use at Membrane):

<video src="/videos/pagination.mp4" muted autoplay controls></video>

### Filtering

You may have noticed that the `page` field accepts parameters for filtering. In the case of GitHub repos, you can optionally pass filters for `type`, `sort`, `direction`, `page`, and `pageSize`.

Filtering options for a collection depend on the API itself. Membrane [API integrations](/concepts/packages/#api-integrations) implement pagination in a standard way as described above, but filtering options will vary from package to package.

In the graph explorer sidebar (seen in the video above), you can select filters in the bottom right corner, below the paginated list.

## Querying from the CLI

You can also make queries from the command line by using
[mctl query](/reference/cli#query). For example:

```shellsession
# Query a scalar
$ mctl query 'github:users.one(name:"membrane-io").bio'

# To query an object, pass a GraphQL query
$ mctl query 'github:users.one(name:"membrane-io")' '{ name bio }'
```

## Resolving queries

### Query execution

This section explains how Membrane queries work by calling the functions
exported from a program. You generally don't need to think about this, but it's
helpful to understand which functions are called when.

When a query is received for a node, Membrane first combines the gref and the
query (if any) into a larger GraphQL query.

If we're querying `{ name bio }` on the above gref, the actual query that will
be executed looks something like this:

```graphql
{
  users {
    one(name: "membrane-io") {
      # The lines above are derived from the gref
      # The lines below come verbatim from the original query
      name
      bio
    }
  }
}
```

Then, to resolve the values, Membrane will invoke these functions in order,
which are all exported from

<Package name="github" />:

1. `Root.users`
2. `UserCollection.one`
3. `User.name`
4. `User.bio`

The result of each resolver is passed as the `obj` argument to all child
resolvers.

### Executing List fields

Resolvers of type `List<T>` must return an array of values. Membrane will then
invoke the resolvers for each item in the array.

For example. If we wanted to get the `name` and `description` of all repos, we
would typically use the following query:

```graphql
{
  repos {
    # The first page of repos
    page {
      items {
        name
        description
      }
    }
    # A gref to the next page
    next
  }
}
```

Membrane would invoke the resolvers in the following order:

1. `Root.repos`
2. `RepositoryCollection.page`
3. `RepositoryPage.items`
4. For each item returned by `RepositoryPage.items`
   1. `Repository.name`
   1. `Repository.description`

### Gref resolvers

Nodes in the graph are identified by their gref. Why? Because APIs typically use
integers IDs, names or UUIDs to identify resources. However, a bare ID is not
enough to interact with its corresponding resource. When using an API directly
you'd also need to know which endpoints to hit and how to pass the ID.

By using grefs to identity graph nodes, we are able to "encode" all the
information needed to interact with something.

All object types have an _implicit_ field aptly named `gref` which can be
queried to get a reference to the node. The `gref` field, when queried, answers
the question "what is the gref that points to this node?".

For example, we could query `user.gref` and would get back
`github:users.one(name:'membrane-io')`. That's not very useful because we
already knew that one. However, when querying a list of nodes, including `gref`
in the query can be useful to know the identify of each returned item. We can
then use the returned grefs to interact with each item individually.

Membrane's IDE uses grefs to identify each node. This is what enables you to
click on a list item and interact with the corresponding node in a generic way
(independent of how each API identifies its resources).

In most cases, you don't need to write a resolver for this field, but it's
important for when you're querying a list of nodes and you want to keep track of
the identity of each item.
