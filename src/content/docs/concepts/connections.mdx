## Add a Program Connection

In Membrane, [programs](/concepts/programs/) can use other programs by forming
_connections_.

Above, the `sys-email` program is selected as a connection from the dropdown menu,
and a gref to the Membrane org in GitHub is dragged from the Navigator. After adding those connections, we access their data and functionality via the `nodes` import from the
`"membrane"` module.

## npm packages

You can also install npm packages as dependencies of a Membrane program. Just
create a `package.json` file, add any packages to the `dependencies` object, and
save the program.

:::note

Not all packages work yet due to runtime differences. Reach out at
[contact@membrane.io](mailto:contact@membrane.io) if you run into compatibility
issues.
