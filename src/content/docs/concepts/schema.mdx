Before learning about schemas, make sure you've read the previous section about
[The Graph](/concepts/the-graph) to understand the core concepts like nodes and
grefs.

## Introduction

The types of nodes that a program exposes in its graph are defined in its
_schema_.

A program's schema consist of a set of _node types_ with _fields_ that define
the available data.

Types can also declare _actions_ which are functions that can be invoked on
them, and _events_ which other programs can be subscribed to.

To summarize, a type is made of

|             |                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| **Fields**  | Values that can be queried  |
| **Actions** | Functions with side effects |
| **Events**  | Subscribable notifications  |

Collectively these are called _members_.

## Editing schemas

Schemas can be edited from the right sidebar and are stored in `memconfig.json`.
You can also edit this file manually when convenient.

## Root Type

All schemas must declare a type named `Root` which defines the type of its _root
node_. The root node serves as the "entry point" into the program, so all grefs
are relative to it.

The root node of each program can be referenced using the program's name
followed by a colon:

- <Gref value="google-calendar:" />
- <Gref value="github:" />
- <Gref value="slack:" />

The trailing colon indicates that it's a gref with no path.

Other nodes are referenced by appending a path. For example, if you had

<Package name="github" /> running, these would all be valid grefs:

| gref                                                                                                              | Refers to a                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| <Gref value="github:users" />                                                                                     | <Type type={`UserCollection`}/>       |
| <Gref value="github:users.one(name:'membrane-io')" />                                                             | <Type type={`User`}/>                 |
| <Gref value="github:users.one(name:'lodash').repos" />                                                            | <Type type={`RepositoryCollection`}/> |
| <div style={{ maxWidth: "40ch" }}><Gref value="github:users.one(name:'lodash').repos.one(name:'lodash')" /></div> | <Type type={`Repository`}/>           |

## Scalar types (Primitives)

Membrane provides a few built-in types for primitives (aka scalars):

- <Type type="String" />
- <Type type="Int" /> (a 53-bit signed integer)
- <Type type="Float" /> (a single-precision floating point number)
- <Type type="Boolean" />
- <Type type="Null" />
- <Type type="Void" /> (used for actions that don't return anything)

As well as a couple of "type wrappers":

- <Type type={{ type: "List", ofType: "T" }} />
- <Type type={{ type: "Gref", ofType: "T" }} />

These two wrappers are essential for implementing
[pagination](/guides/pagination) in a unified way across all programs and
drivers.

## Object types

As mentioned above, programs can define their own types with fields, actions and
events.

To illustrate this section, we'll use a simplified `PullRequest` type from <Package name="github" /> with the following schema:

```yaml
PullRequest
  Fields
    id: int
    number: Int
    title: String
    body: String
    owner: User
    comments: CommentCollection

  Actions
    merge(message: String): Void
    close(message: String): Void

  Events
    closed: ClosedEvent
```

### Actions

Actions are functions that can be invoked in the context of a graph node.

For example, the type <Type type="PullRequest"/> in <Package name="github"/> declares a
<Action name="merge" /> action which can be invoked on a pull request.

For each action declared in the schema, you must define a corresponding function
that gets called when the action is invoked.

We'll learn more about actions in the [Actions](/concepts/actions) section.

### Fields

Fields define the data that can be queried from a node.

Fields can be scalars, lists, grefs, or other object types.

Fields _can_ have a corresponding "resolver" function that gets invoked during
queries.

We'll learn more about queries in the [Queries](/concepts/queries) section.

### Events

Any Membrane program can emit events on their nodes and subscribe to events on
nodes of other programs.

For example, the type <Type type="Issue"/> in <Package name="github"/> declares a
<Event name="closed" /> event, which is emitted when a specific issue is closed.

Events can optionally have a pair of corresponding functions called `subscribe`
and `unsubscribe` that get invoked when the event is subscribed to or
unsubscribed from.

We'll learn more about events in the [Events](/concepts/events) section.
