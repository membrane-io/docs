Membrane Logs are semantically rich, so every action, query, or event can be inspected with a click. In the screen recording below, we take a look at Logs for invoking actions, sending email, and receiving an HTTP GET request.

## Perfect observability

Everything that happens in Membrane gets written to the program's log first (SQLite file in the backend). The log is the source of truth. For something to happen, it must first go in the log before being processed.

Having a write-ahead log means that Membrane has _perfect observability._ If it's not in the log, it didn't happen. And since the database records all communication between programs, you can trace events from end to end. When using Membrane you can always understand what happened.
