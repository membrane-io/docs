Code sharing in Membrane happens through our package registry. You might've already used the registry to install an [API driver](/concepts/drivers) or [share your first program](/getting-started/hello-world/#sharing-your-code).

:::tip
We're excited to see what you build! Post your share link on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4RHyJDV8kj), or [send us an email](mailto:contact@membrane.io). We'll share our favorites in the changelog.

## Installing

To install a package, select "Search Packages..." in the `NEW PROGRAM` menu, or click `FIND PROGRAMS` in the top right of the IDE.

## Publishing

To share your code, you publish it as a package. _This only shares your codeâ€”not your program state nor logs._

If the program you want to share relies on other programs as [connections](/concepts/connections), you'll have to publish those first.

<!-- ## Unpublishing

To unpublish a package, right-click the program to select "Publish Package..." (same as publishing), and click `UNPUBLISH`.

If other packages point to the package you want to unpublish as a dependency, you'll have to unpublish those first, or re-publish them using a different connection. -->
