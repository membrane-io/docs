Any Membrane program can _emit_ events on their nodes and _subscribe to_ events on nodes of other programs. In the [Schema](/concepts/schema) section we gave the example of a <Event name="closed" /> on a `PullRequest` node type.

As another example, let's say you have a program that handles webhooks. A node in your program could emit a <Event name="webhookReceived" /> event, and another program could subscribe to that event.

## Emitting events

Here we are emitting that <Event name="webhookReceived" /> event from a program's root node.

```ts twoslash "$emit()"
// @module: esnext
// @filename: membrane.d.ts
declare module "membrane" {
  namespace resolvers {
    export interface Root {
      endpoint(req: {
        method: "GET" | "POST" | "PUT" | "PATCH" | "DELETE" | "HEAD" | "OPTIONS"
        path: string
        body?: string
        query?: string
        headers: string
      }): string
    }
  }
  /**
   * A gref to the root of this program.
   */
  export const root: Root
}

// ---cut---
import type { root } from "membrane"

export function endpoint(req) {
  switch (`${req.method} ${req.path}`) {
    case "POST /webhook-path":
      root.webhookReceived.$emit()
  }
}
```

Reference our [event API docs](/reference/typescript-api/#emit) for more on `.$emit()`.

## Subscribing to events

Programs can subscribe an action to handle an event. When an event is emitted, the action will be invoked with an additional parameter called `event`.

Here we are subscribing a program to the <Event name="webhookReceived" /> event with a <Action name="doSomething" /> action as its handler. Note that this subscribing program would have the emitting program as a [connection](/concepts/connections).

```ts twoslash "$subscribe(doSomething)"
// @module: esnext
// @filename: membrane.d.ts
type State = import("./index").State
declare module "membrane" {
  /**
   * This object is automatically persisted by Membrane.
   * Its type is defined by the exported `State` interface
   * below.
   */
  export const state: State
}

// ---cut---
import type { nodes } from "membrane"

export async function doSomething(_, { event }) {
  // Do something with the webhookReceived event
}

export async function configure() {
  nodes.webhookReceived.$subscribe(doSomething)
}
```
