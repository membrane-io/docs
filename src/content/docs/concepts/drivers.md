title: API Drivers
---

A _driver_ is a Membrane program that wraps a third-party API so that other
programs can easily make use of it.

There's nothing fundamentally special about a driver. It's a program just like
any other. That means you can create your own drivers for you or other Membrane
users to use.

:::note

If you do create a driver, publish it and let us know or share it on

## Installing drivers

To install a driver in your Membrane graph, click the `ðŸ”Ž SEARCH` button in the
Navigator (top left, next to `+ NEW`). From there you can browse or search for
packages that other users and the Membrane team have published.
